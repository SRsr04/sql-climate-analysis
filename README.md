# US State Climate SQL Analysis

This project explores climate data across US states using advanced SQL techniques including:
- Window Functions (AVG, MIN, MAX, LAG, RANK)
- Partitioning and ordering
- Quantile classification with NTILE
- Aggregation by year and state

The dataset (`state_climate`) is a fictional table used for learning purposes. A labeled map of the United States can be found here -> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Map_of_USA_with_state_names_2.svg# sql-climate-analysis
